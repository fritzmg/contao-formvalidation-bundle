Validation of form fields as you type
=====================================

trilobit_formvalidation offers you a live validation of form fields based on the LiveValidation javascript library (http://www.livevalidation.com). Validation is done as you type. CSS classes are used to give instant feedback to users.

For consistency reasons the extension uses the same regular expressions as core Contao as well as the same error or warning messages, if validation fails.

It works immediately after installation. You may want to adapt CSS classes to your individual context. 

The following forms are supported

* Register
* Login
* Change personal data
* Password service
* Close account
* (Un)subscribe to newsletter
* ...and of course all forms generated by form generator.
